These changes in the log values of Forex rates, price indices, and stock prices return often form a bell-shaped curve. For stock returns, the standard deviation is often called volatility. If returns are normally distributed, more than 99 percent of the returns are expected to fall within the deviations of the mean value. Such characteristics of the bell-shaped normal distribution allow analysts and investors to make statistical inferences about the expected return and risk of stocks. \n",

If we roll two dice simultaneously, there are 36 possible combinations. The probability of rolling ‘1’ (with six possible combinations) again averages to around 16.7%, i.e., (6/36).

When we add both, it equals one. If we toss coins multiple times, the sum of the probability of getting heads and tails will always remain 1."
